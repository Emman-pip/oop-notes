* Variables and data types

* variables
- used to store information, to be referenced and manipulated later

* Data type
- character (char)
  + holds a single character
- string
  + holds a set of characters
- boolean
  + holds true of false values
- float and double
  + holds floating point numbers
  + double has higher precision than float
- integer
  + java has multiple data types for integers (in ascending order): byte, short, int, long
    
* Declaring a variable
- a variable in java must has three things:
  1. data type
  2. identifier
  3. value (optional)
     
#+begin_src java
int integerVariable; // declares variable without setting a value (simply initializinga a variable for later use or storing)
String stringVariable = "This is a string" // a variable that declares data type, identifier, and initializes the vairable with a value

// reassing or assigning values
integerVariable = 10; // assigns 10 to the variable
stringVariable = "new value"; // assign new value to the stringVariable
#+end_src

* Rules for identifiers
- except "_" or underscore, no special characters are allowed
- no whitespaces
- cannot use numbers alone, cannot start with numbers

* concatenation
- process of joining string together with


#+begin_src java
  String s1 = "hello ";
  String s2 = "world.";
  String s3 = s1 + s2; // s3 will be "hello world."
#+end_src
